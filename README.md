# G-Research_Crypto_Prediction_2021
This repository has my Notebook for Kaggle's [G-Research Crypto Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting). 
The contest asks participants to use Machine Learning expertise to predict cryptocurrency market data. Please see the context homepage for more details.

Project Status: Active\
Contest Status: Closed

I only had time to complete 1 submission before the contest closed, but because of my interest in the cryptocurrency market, I kept the analysis going after that.

## Project Objectives
1. Achieve high accuracy of prediction. Here, I use the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) suggested by the contest organizers.
2. Leverage sklearn pipelines to make the program more readable and scalable.

## Methods Used
1. Linear Regression
2. LightGBM 
3. Data Visualization

## Technologies
* Python (sklearn, pandas, numpy)
